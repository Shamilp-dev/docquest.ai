feat: implement MongoDB GridFS for Vercel serverless compatibility

BREAKING CHANGE: File storage migrated from filesystem to MongoDB GridFS

## Changes

### Core Implementation
- Add GridFS connection helper (lib/gridfs.ts)
- Update upload route to use GridFS instead of filesystem
- Add download route to stream files from GridFS
- Enhance delete route to remove files from both DB and GridFS
- Add proper authentication checks for all routes

### Database Schema
- Add gridfsId field to documents collection
- Files now stored in uploads.files and uploads.chunks (GridFS)

### Benefits
- ✅ Vercel serverless compatible (no filesystem required)
- ✅ Scalable storage through MongoDB Atlas
- ✅ Automatic file chunking for large files
- ✅ Geographic distribution via MongoDB replicas
- ✅ Built-in backup and recovery

### Documentation
- Add GRIDFS_SETUP.md for technical documentation
- Add DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md for deployment guide
- Add GRIDFS_MIGRATION.md for migration overview
- Add README_GRIDFS.md for quick start guide
- Add test and deploy scripts

### Testing
- Add scripts/test-gridfs.sh for testing setup
- Add scripts/deploy.sh for quick deployment

## Migration Notes

Existing files in uploads/ folder will need to be re-uploaded through
the new API. The GridFS system will handle all new uploads automatically.

## Environment Variables Required

- MONGODB_URI (existing)
- OPENAI_API_KEY (existing)
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET (existing)
- NEXTAUTH_URL (set to production URL)

## Deployment Instructions

1. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Push this commit to trigger deployment
3. Test upload/download functionality
4. Verify files appear in MongoDB Atlas GridFS collections
